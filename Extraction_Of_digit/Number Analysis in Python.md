# 🔢 Number Analysis in Python

This project includes basic number operations implemented in Python to demonstrate key programming concepts. It covers:

- 📏 Counting digits
- 🔁 Reversing a number
- 🔁 Checking for palindrome
- 🧮 Checking for Armstrong numbers

---

## 🚀 Features

### ✅ 1. Count Digits in a Number

**Input:**

Enter a number to count its number of digits: 12345

**Output:**

Number of digit in 12345 is 5

---

### 🔄 2. Reverse a Number

**Input:**

Enter a number to reverse: 123

**Output:**

Reverse of 123 is 321

---

### 🔁 3. Check Palindrome Number

A number that reads the same forward and backward.

**Input:**

Enter a number to check palindrome: 121

**Output:**

121 is a palindrome number

**Non-palindrome Example:**

123 is not a palindrome number

---

### 💫 4. Check Armstrong Number

An **Armstrong number** is one whose digits raised to the power of number of digits equals the number itself.

**Input:**

Enter a number to check if it is armstrong number or not: 153

**Output:**

153 is an armstrong number

**Explanation:**
153 = 1³ + 5³ + 3³ = 153
