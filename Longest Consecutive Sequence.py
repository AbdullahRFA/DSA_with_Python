"""
Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.



Example 1:

Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,0,1,2]
Output: 3

‚úÖ Problem Summary:

Given an unsorted list of integers, return the length of the longest consecutive sequence.
The goal is to do this in O(n) time.

‚∏ª

1Ô∏è‚É£ Brute Force Solution

üîç Approach:
	‚Ä¢	For each number x in the array:
	‚Ä¢	Check whether x+1, x+2, ‚Ä¶, exist in the array.
	‚Ä¢	Count how long the sequence goes starting from x.

üß† Logic:

for x in nums:
    count = 1
    while x + 1 in nums:
        x += 1
        count += 1
    max_count = max(max_count, count)

‚è±Ô∏è Time Complexity:
	‚Ä¢	Outer loop: O(n)
	‚Ä¢	Inner loop (search in list): O(n) in worst case (because in takes O(n) in a list)
	‚Ä¢	Overall: O(n¬≤)

üß† Space Complexity:
	‚Ä¢	O(1) (no extra space except variables)

‚∏ª

2Ô∏è‚É£ Better (Sorting-Based) Solution

üîç Approach:
	‚Ä¢	Sort the array.
	‚Ä¢	Loop through the sorted array and count increasing consecutive elements.
	‚Ä¢	Handle duplicates by skipping them.

üß† Logic:

nums.sort()
for x in nums:
    if x == last: continue
    elif x == last + 1: count += 1
    else: count = 1

‚è±Ô∏è Time Complexity:
	‚Ä¢	Sorting: O(n log n)
	‚Ä¢	Traversal: O(n)
	‚Ä¢	Overall: O(n log n)

üß† Space Complexity:
	‚Ä¢	Depends:
	‚Ä¢	O(1) for in-place sort
	‚Ä¢	O(n) if sort creates a new list

‚∏ª

3Ô∏è‚É£ Optimal Solution (Using Set)

üîç Approach:
	‚Ä¢	Convert nums to a set for O(1) lookup.
	‚Ä¢	Loop through each number, and only start counting if x - 1 is not in the set (i.e., start of a new sequence).
	‚Ä¢	Count the length of the sequence from x.

üß† Logic:

nums_set = set(nums)
for x in nums_set:
    if x - 1 not in nums_set:
        count = 1
        while x + 1 in nums_set:
            x += 1
            count += 1

‚è±Ô∏è Time Complexity:
	‚Ä¢	Converting to set: O(n)
	‚Ä¢	Traversal: O(n)
	‚Ä¢	Each element is visited at most once in the inner while loop.
	‚Ä¢	Overall: O(n) ‚úÖ

üß† Space Complexity:
	‚Ä¢	Set to hold n elements ‚Üí O(n)

‚úÖ Final Comparison Table

Method	    Time Complexity	    Space Complexity	             Notes
Brute Force	    O(n¬≤)	            O(1)	        Simple, but too slow for large input
Sorting Based	O(n log n)	      O(1) or O(n)	    Acceptable, but not optimal
Optimal (Set)	O(n)	            O(n)	        Best choice ‚Äì Fast and efficient ‚úÖ
