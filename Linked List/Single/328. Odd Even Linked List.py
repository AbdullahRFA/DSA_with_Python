"""
Given the head of a singly linked list, group all the nodes with odd indices together followed by the nodes with even indices, and return the reordered list.

The first node is considered odd, and the second node is even, and so on.

Note that the relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.

You must solve the problem in O(1) extra space complexity and O(n) time complexity.



Example 1:


Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [1,3,5,2,4]
Example 2:


Input: head = [2,1,3,5,6,4,7]
Output: [2,3,6,7,1,5,4]


Constraints:

The number of nodes in the linked list is in the range [0, 104].
-106 <= Node.val <= 106

ðŸ’¡ Brute Force Approach (Your Initial Attempt)

Technique:
	1.	Traverse and collect odd-indexed nodesâ€™ values in a list.
	2.	Traverse again and collect even-indexed nodesâ€™ values.
	3.	Concatenate both.
	4.	Rewrite values in the original list node-by-node.

Time Complexity: O(N)

Space Complexity: O(N) (uses an extra list)

Pros:
	â€¢	Simple and intuitive.

Cons:
	â€¢	Not space-efficient. Doesnâ€™t take advantage of the linked list structure.
	â€¢	Modifies node values instead of pointers.

â¸»

âœ… Optimal Approach (In-Place Pointer Manipulation)

Technique:
	1.	Split the list into two parts:
	â€¢	Odd-indexed nodes.
	â€¢	Even-indexed nodes.
	2.	Use two pointers: odd and even.
	3.	Traverse while connecting odds to odds and evens to evens.
	4.	Finally, connect the end of the odd list to the head of the even list.

Time Complexity: O(N)

Space Complexity: O(1) (no extra space)

Pros:
	â€¢	In-place.
	â€¢	Maintains node order and structure.

Cons:
	â€¢	Slightly more pointer manipulation logic.
